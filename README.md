 process is more than the program code, which is sometimes known as the text section.
It also includes the current activity, as represented by the value of the program
counter and the contents of the processorâ€™s registers. A process generally also
includes the process stack, which contains temporary data (such as function
parameters, return addresses, and local variables), and a data section, which
contains global variables. A process may also include a heap, which is memory
that is dynamically allocated during process run time.a
